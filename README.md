# Ionic Dev App - Custom

This is an experimental version of the now defunct Ionic DevApp that developers compile themselves using the native plugins and functionality they need. Then that app can be used to test their apps without any limitations. Think of it as a special on-device test and debug experience for your app.

## Getting Started

Before starting, you'll need to have all [required dependencies of Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com/docs/getting-started/dependencies) for the platform you will run on.

To get started, clone the repo, then run

```bash
npm install
npx cap sync
npx cap open ios
```

Then build and run it right in the IDE.
